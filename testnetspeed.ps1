.SYNOPSIS
    Determine network speed in Mbps
.DESCRIPTION
    This script will create a dummy file, default size of 20mb, and copy to
    and from a target server.  The Mbps will be determined from the time it 
    takes to perform this operation.
    
    A folder will be created in the designated Path location called SpeedTest.
    The dummy file will be copied to and from that location to determine the
    network speed.
.PARAMETER Path
    Each Path specified must be in UNC format, i.e. \\server\share
.PARAMETER Size
    Designate the size of the dummy file in MB
.INPUTS
    <string> UNC of path
.OUTPUTS
    PSCustomObject
        Server          Name of Server
        TimeStamp       Time when script was run
        WriteTime       TimeSpan object of how long the write test took
        WriteMbps       Mbps of the write test
        ReadTime        TimeSpan object of how long the read test took
        ReadMbps        Mbps of the read test
.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-NetworkSpeed.ps1 -Path "\\server1\share","\\server2\share2"
.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-NetworkSpeed.ps1 -Path (Get-Content c:\shares.txt) -Size 25 -Verbose
    
    Pulls paths from c:\Shares.txt (in UNC format), creates a 25mb dummy file for
    testing and produces Verbose output.
.EXAMPLE
    Get-Content c:\shares.txt | .\Test-NetworkSpeed.ps1 -Size 100
    
    Also pulls paths from c:\Shares.txt, but takes input from the pipeline.  Dummy
    file size will be 100mb.
